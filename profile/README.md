Yes, we are building RnD Center Server on GitHub. In fact, we’ve been doing this since **November 28th, 2021**. That's when we made our first commit. Since then we pushed **over 300 hundred commits**, opened **over mindboggling 4 issues**, submitted roughly **3 pull requests** across **74 repositories** from over **1 country** 🤯. But that's just us. We are proud  to be part of the work of 6 of developers.

### 🍿 An interconnected community

The open source community is the 💗 heart of GitHub and fundamental to how we build software today. See for yourself:

- [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors) helped support more than **5k** individuals and projects around the world 🌍
- Open source projects on GitHub received a stunning **218 million** contributions 🚀 in the last year alone
- **Every minute** a developer creates a new release 🏄 for a public project on GitHub

Now that we are talking about the important things ☝️, are you contributing to open source? Yes? Okay, you rock! 🎸 If not, we can help you get started! Open source software is made by people just like you. Learn more about [how to contribute](https://opensource.guide/).
